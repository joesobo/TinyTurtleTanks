# Tiny Turtle Tanks V1.1

Hello, and welcome to Tiny Turtle Tanks. This is a small Unity-engine based game that I have been developing. You start playing the game as a tiny little Turtle who must travel through the galaxy, defending each planet from enemies. 

## Accomplishments ##
Just a few things that I'm proud of learning and would like to highlight from my time spent on this project.

* Minature Planetary gravity for (most) objects
* Basic AI with multiple states
* Custom water and grass shaders
* Custom editor (for dev tools)
* Creating a working menu
* New art style developed in Blender and MagicaVoxel
* Polish with VFX and Cinemachine
* and plenty more
